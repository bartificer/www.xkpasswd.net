# XKPasswdJS â€” The Official JavaScript Port of Crypt::HSXKPasswd

[Bart Busschots](https://www.bartb.ie/) created the [Crypt::HSXKPasswd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::HSXKPasswd) Perl module to be a liberally licensed ([2-clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)) password generator for producing secure but memorable passwords using the word-based approach made famous by the [*Correct Horse Battery Staple* XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/936/).

![To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)
 
Bart is leading this port of the Perl module to JavaScript with the [NosillaCast community](https://podfeet.com/slack) as part of the on-going Programming By Stealth blog/podcast series](https://pbs.bartificer.net) he produces with [Allison Sheridan](https://www.podfeet.com/blog/about/).

## Project Plan

The plan is to develop this port in the following broad stages:

1. **Project Skeleton** â€” project infrastructure and specification for direct port
   * Bart will work mostly solo with only typo-like pull requests accepted
   * Outcomes:
     * ULM Class Diagram defining the API for the direct port
     * Contribution guides for developers including a project code style, a Git branching policy, and a style guide for Git commits
     * Configuration files for the project tooling, specically WebPack (bundler), JSLint (code linter), JSDoc (documentation generator), and Jest (test suite)
     * Automations/Scripts to build the project, run the test suite, and build the documentation
2. **Direct Port** â€” implementation of a feature-for-feature port of the Perl module to JavaScript
   * Pull requests implementing the documented design and following the contribution guidelines will be gratefully accepted
   * The issue tracker will be opened and used to track bugs and enhancement requests
   * Outcomes:
     * An ES6 JavaScript module implementing the documented API
     * Detailed documentation
     * A Jest test suite with full code coverage
     * An officual NPM package for the module
3. **Maintenance & Enhancement** â€” bug fixes, security patches, and feature enhancements
   * Details to be agreed later based on the experiences from phase 2.

**The project is currently in phase 1 â€” project skeleton**.

## Repository Structure

Fundamentally, the repository is a NodeJS project, so it contains the standard NodeJS files. In addition to these standard files, the projects assets are stored in the following structure:

* `/buildScripts/` â€” the folder containing the scripts used to build the bundled versions of the module and the module's documentation site, including its UML diagrams.
* `/dist/` â€” the target folder into which the build scripts will publish the bundled versions of the module, ready for distribution. **Do not edit the contents of this folder directly!**
* `/docs/` â€” the target folder into which the build scripts will publish the generated documentation. This folder's contents will be published as the project's website. **Do not edit the contents of this folder directly!**
* `/docs-static/` â€” the folder containing the parts of the documentation that are not generated from documentation comments.
* `/docs-static/diagrams/` â€” the target folder into which the build scripts will publish PNG versions of the project's UML diagrams. The source for these diagrams are the Mermaid files in `/src-diagrams/`.
* `/src/` â€” the folder containing the module's source code and test suite.
* `/src-diagrams/` â€” the folder containing the source code for the UML diagrams describing the module. These files will be in Mermaid format, and will be transformed into PNG files in `/docs-static/diagrams/` by a build script.

## Contributor & Developer Resources & Guides

This project is managed through GitHub. To contribute by starting or commentong on feature requests or bug reports you'll need [a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). The project's home on GitHub is at [github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js/).

### Prerequistes

If you download the raq code you'll need the following to build the project, i.e. transform the raw code into a usable JavaScript modules with documentation, you'll need:

1. The most recent LTS (Long Term Support) version of the NodeJS runtime available at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. A POSIX-compliant shell and terminal app capable of running Bash scripts â€” standard on Linux & Mac, and available for Windows through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) .
   * Microsoft's documentation for installing WSL â€” [learn.microsoft.com/â€¦](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
   * The offocial Bash documentation â€” [www.gnu.org/â€¦](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html)
3. Sufficient confidence on the commandline to navigate to a folder and run basic commands
   * (you might find [the Taming the Terminal series](https://pbs.bartificer.net/) helpful ðŸ˜‰)

To contribute documentation or code changes back to the project you'll also need:

1. A supported version of the Git versioning system, and optionally a Git GUI of your choice.
   * Git's official download page â€” [git-scm.com/â€¦](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. A working understanding of the Markdown markup language
3. A code editor, ideally with Markdown and/or JavaScript syntax highlighting.
   * To contribute code your editor of choice must support [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

### Relevant Documentation

When altering the code you may find links to the documentation for the various technologies used within the project's code and tool chain useful:

* Mozilla's Excellent JavaScript documentation â€” [developer.mozilla.org/â€¦](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* Documentation for the NPN (Node Package Manager) CLI â€” https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/
* JSDoc & DocDash
* Documentation for the project's code linter, ESLint â€” [eslint.org/â€¦](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/)
* Documentation for Jest, the project's code testing tool â€” [jestjs.io/â€¦](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
* Documentation the prokect's bundler, Webpack â€” [webpack.js.org/â€¦](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
